‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning

This script makes deep modifications to the Windows operating system. Disabling system services, drivers, or renaming system files can lead to instability, unexpected behavior, or the failure of critical system functions (such as Windows Update, Windows Defender, network features, etc.).

Use at your own risk!

It is strongly recommended to create a system backup or a system restore point before applying any major changes.

This script is intended for power users, gamers, and tweakers who understand the potential consequences of their actions.
